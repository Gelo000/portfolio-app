If you have already built your Angular app with the production configuration and published it to the `docs` folder on GitHub, you don't need to run the build command again unless you have made further changes to your app and want to update the GitHub Pages version.

If you have made updates to your Angular app and want to reflect those changes on your GitHub Pages, you should follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of your Angular project.

2. Run the following command to build your app with the production configuration:

   ```bash
   ng build --configuration=production --output-path docs --base-href /portfolio-app/
   ```

   This will generate an updated production build of your app in the `docs` folder.

3. Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository. Use the following commands:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update app for GitHub Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

   This will push the changes, including the updated build files, to your GitHub repository.

After completing these steps, your GitHub Pages should be updated with the latest version of your Angular app.
